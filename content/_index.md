for this process THREAD plays a major role_`n`n`n   _One thread loads a webpage(i.e SPOTIFY webpage)_`n`n`n   _Another plays a plays the song._`n`n`n`nFor more simple breakdown we can refer to the figure below:`n`n`n<img width="1120" height="561" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9ba385f-3037-4795-9238-57d7cd6c1cc4" />`n`nWhen APC Injection is done it needs a Virtual Memory.Lets understand this`n`n# **VIRTUAL MEMORY**`nVirtual memory is a technique used by an operating system that lets programs think they have a large, continuous memory space, even though the actual RAM is limited and scattered in different places.`n`nin other words Virtual memory makes each process think it owns all memory.`n`nBut what are the **Objectives** of a Virtual Memory`n * A program does not need to be fully loaded into memory(RAM) to run; only the required parts are loaded[Lazy Loading]`n * Programs can be larger than the system’s physical RAM.`n * Virtual memory makes it seem like the system has more memory than it actually does.`n * It uses both RAM and disk space, loading program parts into RAM only when needed.`n * This helps the system run more programs at the same time and use memory efficiently.`n`n`n<img width="1042" height="745" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7a34058-17e3-406c-9d3c-93f348785acf" />`n`nBut how does a Computer use Virtual Memory to manage / run A PROGRAM`n`nwell a Virtal Memory also need permission to **READ , WRITE AND EXECUTE** an assigned Process.`n`nNow each Process has its own private virtual memory that is protected from other processes`n`nthat takes us to a brief note of `n# **MEMORY PERMISSIONS (R/W/X)** `n`n* **Read (R):** Allows a program to read data from a memory location.`n* **Write (W):** Allows a program to modify or store data in a memory location.`n* **Execute (X):** Allows the CPU to run instructions from a memory location.`n* These permissions prevent misuse of memory, such as executing data or modifying code.`n* The operating system enforces these permissions to keep programs secure and stable.`n`n  In contect to the APC INJECTION Shellcode (malicious code) is written into the virtual memory space of the target process _(ex-notepad.exe)_.`n`n`n  Even if there are permissions for VirtualallocEx() attackers can misuse the memory by using shell code but what is it ?`n# **SHELL CODE** `n`n  A Shell Code is basically a A malicious Payload (CODE) that can make our system Vulnerable , but to run this payload in Virtual Memory the attacker needs to`n  write it in a memory location with EXECUTE(X) permissions . It runs directly from the memory (ex - RAM ) of the machine i.e insted of running a program like`n  androidstudio.exe the instructions (shellcode) will run directly through memeory .   `n  `nThere are some important points that must be noted:`n`n  -If memory is not executable, shellcode cannot run.`n`n  -So attackers ensure memory has Execute permission.`n`n   __Shellcode is the “secret instruction” delivered via APC.__ `n`n`n  Figure Reference:`n`n  <img width="1588" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/785ab603-6337-47c3-9ebc-5eb1fd8a7f90" />`n`n`n`n  Now since we know the basics we can continue our Journey to APC `n`n`n`n   But before we talk about APC there is one more important thing and that is **WINDOWS API**`n`n   # **WINDOWS API** `n`n  -In simple words these are the commands through which programs ask windows to run/do things .`n`n   for example`n `n  * opening a file`n`n`n  * allocating a memory`n`n   Since APC INJECTION is more about using THREADS ,`n`n   in programs to pinpoint a specific thread we need a unique id right? And here comes the role of **HANDLE**`n `n   # **HANDLE**`n      It is the OS-approved reference that allows safe and controlled operations on that exact thread.`n `n  - A Handle is a unique identifier that gives access to a specific thread or process that an attacker can use to ADD their APC to the TARGETS thread queue.`n`n    simplying it the process or thread is a room and handle is a KEY to that room .`n`n    like in the figure below we can see with the use of WINDOWS API , THREAD , HANDLE .`n`n`n    <img width="1598" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/134e43de-af08-4bea-97e6-f3f1a652ecb1" />`n`n`n`n`n    Now that we are almost done with the prerequisites, let us connect these concepts and gradually move toward our main topic of discussion, beginning with what we mean   by an Asynchronous Procedure Call (APC).`n    `n`n**What Is APC?**`n`nAPC stands for Asynchronous Procedure Call.`n`nAn Asynchronous Procedure Call is a mechanism in Windows where a function is scheduled to execute inside a specific thread, rather than running immediately.`n`nIn simple terms:`n`nAn APC is a request sent to a thread asking it to execute a piece of code at a later time.`n`nBreaking Down “Asynchronous Procedure Call”`n`n**Asynchronous**`n`nThe task does not run immediately`n`nIt does not block other operations`n`nIt runs later, when the system decides it is safe to do so`n`n**Procedure Call**`n`nA request to execute a specific set of instructions`n`nRuns within a defined execution context, that is, a thread`n`n`n**There are three types of APCs**`n`n   * SIMPLE APC`n   * EARLY BIRD APC`n   * SPECIAL USER APC`n`n`n     **SIMPLE APC** - A simple APC runs only when a thread is waiting or idle (in an alertable`n     state)`n`n       for example :`n`n       You are listening to a Song on Spotify (not  a premium user) and the AD only plays when`n       the song has ended not in between i.e The ad does not interrupt the song immediately it`n       waits until the song finishes just like that SIMPLE APC waits until thread is ready .`n`n       <img width="364" height="193" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ecc5be-a28d-41e7-8e5e-6e4707efb02f" />`n`n`n`n     **EARLY BIRD APC** - In this the APC is queued before that thread starts running so`n       that it executes as soon as the thread begins`n`n       for example :`n`n       You open SPOTIFY (again not premium) and AD plays immediatley that is The AD is ready`n       before the start of the song/music even before the APP fully loads.`n`n       <img width="363" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e12ecbb3-23ef-4645-8260-897c6340f64e" />`n`n`n       `n     **SPECIAL USER APC** - It is a high priority APC and run when certain system events happen`n       even if the thread is not waiting .`n`n       for example :`n`n       While streaming on spotify you come across a forced AD means the the AD is`n       event-triggered , it does not wait for the song to end because it is HIGH PRIORITY`n`n`n       <img width="368" height="192" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f5dc1df-ff78-4f3a-a5cb-081fe7bedd43" />`n`n`n`n`n   `n`n`n`n`n<img width="813" height="82" alt="image"

Injection.`n`n# **WHAT IS APC INJECTION?**`n`nAPC Injection is a process injection technique that abuses Windows’ APC mechanism to execute malicious code inside an existing thread, without creating a new thread.`n`nIn simple words:`n`nThe attacker injects shellcode into memory and queues it as an APC, waiting for the right moment to execute.`n`n# **APC QUEUE**`n`nThe APC Queue is a per-thread waiting list where Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs) are stored until they can be executed.`n`nKey points:`n`nAPCs are queued, not executed immediately`n`nEach thread has its own APC queue`n`nAPCs wait until execution conditions are met`n`nAnalogy:`nLike background notifications piling up while you study, APCs wait silently in the queue.`n`n# **ALERTABLE STATE**`n`nThe Alertable State is a special state where a thread temporarily pauses its main execution to process APCs from its APC queue.`n`nKey points:`n`nAllows queued APCs to execute`n`nOccurs during specific wait operations`n`nNormal execution resumes afterward`n`nAnalogy:`nLike a scheduled study break for doom scrolling, the thread takes a pause, handles pending tasks, and then gets back to work.`n`n`nRefer to the figure below for better understanding`n`n`n  <img width="808" height="212" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2a37c0f-ef78-4963-ac0a-699a329791f8" />`n`n  `n`n# **Now let’s actually see APC Injection (a demonstration, not a real attack)**`n`n`nUp until now, everything we discussed lived in theory.`n`nProcesses.`nThreads.`nMemory.`nAPCs waiting patiently in queues.`n`nBut concepts truly click only when you see them happen.`n`nSo in this section, we’ll walk through a small, controlled demonstration of APC Injection.`n`nNot a real attack.`nNot malware.`nNo persistence.`nNo damage.`n`nJust enough to watch the mechanism breathe.`n`nThink of it like pressing the transparent side panel of a CPU cabinet you’re not breaking anything, just observing how things move inside.`n`n# **What this demonstration is (and what it isn’t)**`n`nLet’s be very clear.`n`nThis demo:`n`nUses a harmless payload (Calculator)`n`nRuns in a controlled environment`n`nExists only to visualize execution flow`n`nThis demo is not:`n`nA real-world malware sample`n`nAn evasion technique`n`nSomething meant to bypass security products`n`nIf theory explained what APC Injection is,`nthis demo explains when and how it actually executes.`n`n# **The idea behind the demo (before code)**`nInstead of jumping straight into code, let’s set the scene.`n`nImagine this sequence:`n`nWindows creates a process, but pauses it before it really starts`n`nWe quietly place some instructions inside its memory`n`nWe don’t force execution`n`nWe don’t create a new thread`n`nWe just say:`n“When you get a break… run this.”`n`nThat polite request is an APC.`n`nAnd because we queue it before the thread even starts, this becomes an Early-Bird APC.`n`nNow let’s see how that looks in code.`n`n# **The demonstration code (reference)**`n`nDon’t try to memorize this.`nWe’ll walk through it like a story.`n````n#include <windows.h>`n`n// shellcode to launch calculator`nunsigned char shellcode[] = `n
